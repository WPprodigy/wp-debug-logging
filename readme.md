# WP Debug Logging

Enable PHP error logging without needing to edit the wp-config.php file. Just need to activate this plugin and logging will be automatically enabled. The log should then be visible from the WordPress admin at Tools > Debug Log.

Note that it isn't ideal to leave error logging enabling on a production server. This plugin is for quickly diagnosing plugin/theme conflicts.
